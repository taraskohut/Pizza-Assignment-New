# Angular Project with JSON Server

This project is an Angular application that uses **JSON Server** as a mock backend for data.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Recommended version **20+**
- **NPM** (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. If JSON Server is not already installed globally, install it:

   ```bash
   npm install -g json-server
   ```
## Running the Application
1. Start the JSON Server and the Angular application using the following command:

   ```bash
    npm run start
   ```
or use Angular CLI directly:
    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```

Open your browser and navigate to:
```plaintext
http://localhost:4200
```
The Angular application will be served here.

Additional Information
JSON Server simulates a REST API. Ensure you have a db.json file in your project directory or configured as per your setup.
Modify db.json to reflect your mock data.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with JSON Server, ensure it is installed globally:


npm install -g json-server
If the Angular application doesn't start, ensure all dependencies are installed correctly with npm install.

Enjoy building your Angular application!
